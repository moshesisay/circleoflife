# Circle of Life

### Controller Purpose
 
To inspire children to express their knowledge of the characters of the movie "The Lion King" in a fun way.

### How to Use It

#### Compilation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Usage

Find a character (or more than one) according to an instruction on the screen. 

Upon clicking on an image, it will play a note.

Upon clicking on the correct image, it will display a word of encouragment.

Upon clicking on an incorrect image, it will still display a word of encouragment. 

Once completing all 12 challenges, a victory message will be displayed.

A player will be informed that they have in fact played the melody of the song "Can you feel the love tonight?" - featured in the movie.

This along with the simple premise and pattern of the game (the solution is clicking all the images one after the other clockwise)
positions the game as a game for children aged 0-10 (6-10 if the kid will read by themselves).

### Modifications and Additions

1. Images have been added to the 12 circles, corresponding to The Lion King characters.
2. Circles have been enlarged to promote readability for children.
3. Notes have been adjusted to the melody of "Can you feel the love tonight?"
4. Titles have been added to describe the game, its title (The Circle of Life) and instructions.
5. An IFrame with the actual song has been added at the end upon completion, played automatically.
6. Words of encourgment colored green (upon success) and red (upon failure) have been added, chosen randomally.
7. The page has been themed as Dark Mode to make it more pleasant to use in more environments.
