CONTROLLER NAME: CIRCLE OF LIFE

CONTROLLER PURPOSE: 
To inspire children to express their knowledge of the characters of the movie "The Lion King" in a fun way.

HOW TO USE IT: 
Find a character (or more than one) according to an instruction on the screen. 
Upon clicking on an image, it will play a note.
Upon clicking on the correct image, it will display a word of encouragment.
Upon clicking on an incorrect image, it will still display a word of encouragment. 
Once completing all 12 challenges, a victory message will be displayed.
A player will be informed that they have in fact played the melody of the song "Can you feel the love tonight?" - featured in the movie.
This along with the simple premise and pattern of the game (the solution is clicking all the images one after the other clockwise)
positions the game as a game for children aged 0-10 (6-10 if the kid will read by themselves).
